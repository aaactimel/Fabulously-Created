## Q&A
**Q:** **Does it compatible with shaders?**  
**A:** **Yes!** Just install shaders you want ([Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) + Euphoria patches highly recommended) and play without much FPS drop!  

**Q:** **Is there any ingame tutorial, like guide books?**  
**A:** **Yes**, while host and client have same mods with same major versions, there should not be any problems with optimization nor bugs.

**Q:** **Is there any changes about optimization compared to Fabulously Optimized?**  
**A:** **No major changes**, but Faster Random, Fast Boot and Fast Paintings was added just to +1-2FPS in heavy scenes.

**Q:** **Is it multiplayer friendly?**  
**A:** **No**, there is no any gifted on start guide books to make real vanilla feel. However, Create has their own tutorial on any modded block (by default you need to hold W when your cursor is on the item in inventory), so you can learn Create with them!

**Q:** **Does it compatible with Steam Deck, Lenovo Legion, ASUS ROG ALLY, MSI Claw?**  
**A:** Practically **yes**, but you need to install [**MidnightControls (1.9.4)**](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols/version/1.9.4+1.20) (not included to modpack because of possible bloating). FPS will be stable; however, lock to 60FPS@1080p recommended (30FPS@720p/1080p for battery saving)  

**Q:** **What should I do, if I encounter any bug or crash?**  
**A:** **Report it to [Issues](https://github.com/aaactimel/Fabulously-Created/issues)**. If this bug does not rely on modpack, it probably won't be fixed, either alternative for bugged mod will be found.
